       <p><b>Technical documentation refers to any document that explains the use, functionality, creation, or architecture of a product.<br> Think of it as a nuts-and-bolts “how to” guide for your users, new hires, administrators, and anyone else who needs to know how your product works.</b></p>

      <b>Step 1.</b>
        Every technical writing project should start with research. Then, create a proper “Documentation Plan” i.e a short outline to help guide you through the project.
      <br><br>
      <b>Step 2. </b> Structure and design
      <br>
The documentation should be structurally logical and easy to navigate.
      Things to be taken into consideration for this are:
     <ul>
       <li>Page design</li>
       <li> Navigational structure<p> P.S : Use templates or “schemas” for consistent on-page design.</p></li>
      </ul>
      </p>
      
      <p><b>The golden commandment of technical writing is “thou shalt not assume”. You might think you’re being obvious, but you have to be aware of the knowledge level your audience is at.</b>

      <p>Front Matter of any technical document must include the following elements:
        <ul>
          
          <li>Title page.</li><p>
  It should include the title, the author and the date. Title should be both clear and detailed enough, so that readers could easily grasp the idea of what is covered.</p>
          <li>Abstract</li><p> This is the summarizing statement. It should neither be too short, nor too long. About 70–150 words is usually enough. Abstract should contain general information about the topic or issue, methods used, main results, and conclusions of your document. Its content should be clear and straightforward as long as it succinctly communicates the purpose of the following document. So, an abstract can save readers’ time.</p>
<li>Table of contents</li><p> It is a list of the subject headings and subheadings of the document.
It is usually provided in long documents such as reports, proposals, and other administrative and research documents. Your table of contents should be properly done, so that readers can easily navigate through the document.</p>
          <li>List of figures.</li> <p>Numerous research suggest that nowadays people prefer visual content to a text because screenshots, charts, pictures allow readers to quickly get the idea. Visual content is important in technical documentation. Create a list of figures in order to organize the visuals and make them easier to navigate.<p>

          <li>List of tables</li> <p>It contains all tables of your document. Make sure not to mix tables and figures in the same list. List of tables is usually organised as a list of figures as described and illustrated above.<p>
          <li>List of terms.</li> <p>Every document contains terminology, acronyms and abbreviations specific to the particular field of knowledge or topic described. Some of these words may confuse even the most knowledgeable readers. That’s why a list of terms is essential in any technical document.<p>
          <li>Acknowledgments.</li> <p>This part of your document should include names of your colleagues, other fellow technical writers and programmers who assisted the development of the document.<p>

    <article>
      <p>Body of the document contains materials with steps to take and/or methods to use in order to resolve the issue presented in the abstract.</p>
      
      <p><ul><li>Introduction</li> <p> This presents the main goal and what to expect further in document. Introduction shouldn’t be confused with abstract. Introduction contains the subject of your document, the issue resolved, the purpose, its scope and background information.
Background information should be relevant. Usually, this part includes the history of the problem, a summary of previous research and reasons why you decided to write this document.</p><br>
<li>Theory.</li> <p>If the document is comparatively long, you should develop a separate section named “theory” that describes all the formulae and techniques used.
Design criteria. This section includes proposals, feasibility reports, recommendation reports with the possible design of a product.
Materials and apparatus. If your document explains, for example, some sort of experiment, you should describe software and hardware used.</p><br>
      <li>Procedure.</li><p> Describe all methods that you used for gathering data.</p>
      <li>Results.</li><p> Sum up the data of the whole project in this part. It can include charts and figures to visualize your results in an effective manner.</p><br>
      <li>Conclusion.</li><p> Sometimes readers, particularly managers, don’t read the whole document to save time. So you need to provide a summary of the main results and other key points of the document.</p></p>

      <p>End matter provides useful information and materials outside the main body. This end part consists of:</p>
      
      <p><ul>
      <li>References.</li><p> A list of sources that you’ve used.</p>
      <li>Appendixes</li><p> This usually includes materials that are not essential parts of the text like additional diagrams, tables, lists, etc.</p>
      <li>Index.</li><p> Develop an index wisely because it should be helpful for your audience. Add to your index important subject, topics, proper names.</p>

    <article>
      <p><b>The one thing your technical documentation has to have is clarity. Ease-of-use is your top priority.</b></p>
      <br><p>Aim for these 4 other qualities:
<br>
 <ul><li>1. Efficiency in development and use:</li> <p>Duplicated content, unorganized structures, and unclear processes can kill technical documentation. Use a tool like Planio’s wikis to keep content organized and efficient.<p>
   <br>
      
   <li>2. Up-to-date information:</li><p> There’s no point in giving your users inaccurate information or showing them dated screenshots that don’t look like what they’re dealing with. Keep your technical documentation up-to-date and current.</p> <br>
      
   <li>3. Consistent design and structure:</li><p> Every time you get in contact with your users is a time to build your brand. Keep consistent with your design, style, and tone across all online documentation.</p><br>
      
<li>4. Accessible anywhere:</li> <p>Mobile is taking over the world. Your technical documentation, just like the rest of your website or app, needs to be responsive and provide a great experience for users on all devices.
