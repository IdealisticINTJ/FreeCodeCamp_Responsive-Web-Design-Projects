<li><b>1963-</b> In early 1963, Just shy of his 21st birthday, Hawking was diagnosed with motor neuron disease, more commonly known as Lou Gehrig's disease or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). </li>        
        <li><b>1964-</b> Stephen publicly challenged the work of noted astronomer Fred Hoyle.</li>
        <li><b>1966-</b> Obtained his PhD degree in applied mathematics and theoretical physics, specialising in general relativity and cosmology.</li>
        <li><b>1970-</b> Appointed 'Sherman Fairchild Distinguished Scholar' at Caltech.</li>
        <li><b>1971-</b> Stephens essay titled "Black Holes" won the Gravity research Foundation Award.</li>

            <p> Hawking was born on 8 January 1942 and grew up in St Albans, the eldest of four siblings.
<br>
His father was a research biologist and his mother a medical research secretary, so it was not surprising that he was interested in science. As a student he was drawn to physics and maths as he believed they offered the most fundamental insights into the world.

            <ul>
              <li><q>When he was a teenager, Stephen and his friends built a computer out of old clock parts, telephone switchboards and other recycled items. This lead his friends to nickname him, 'Einstein'!
                </q></li>
              <li><q>The animated version of Stephen Hawking appeared on The Simpsons for which he lent his voice himself.</q></li>
              <li><q>Stephen grew up in a house where education was very important. His parents were both academics who had studied at Oxford University. Dinner times were often spent in silence while the family read books!</q></li>
